# Launching the Application

Once installed, you can launch the "Manhwa OCR Tool" from your system's application menu (Start Menu on Windows, Applications folder on macOS). If you are running from source, execute `python main.py` in your terminal from the project directory.

### Splash Screen

Upon launch, you will first see a **Splash Screen**. This screen indicates that the application is initializing its components in the background. You will see status messages appear at the bottom, such as "Loading application settings..." and "Finding recent projects..."

The splash screen provides visual feedback that the app is starting up correctly. Once initialization is complete, you will automatically be taken to the **Home Window**, your central hub for managing projects.
