# Installation

Getting the Manhwa OCR Tool installed is the first step. For the best stability and performance, we strongly recommend running the application directly from its source code.

## 1. From Source Code (Recommended Method)

This method ensures you have the latest stable version and the correct dependencies for your system. You will need Python (3.8+ recommended) and `pip` installed.

### Step 1: Install PyTorch (Crucial First Step)

The application's OCR engine relies on PyTorch. It must be installed separately **before** other dependencies to ensure you get the version compatible with your hardware (especially if you have an NVIDIA GPU for CUDA acceleration).

1.  **Go to the Official PyTorch Website:** Open your browser and navigate to [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/).
2.  **Use the Install Helper:** On the homepage, you will find a configuration tool. Select your preferences (e.g., Stable, your OS, Pip, Python, your CUDA version or CPU).
3.  **Copy and Run the Command:** The website will generate a specific `pip install` command for you. Copy it and run it in your terminal.

> **Example Command (Do NOT blindly copy this!)**
> The command generated for you might look something like this for a system with CUDA 12.1:
> ```bash
> pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
> ```
> **Your command will likely be different.** Always use the command generated by the official PyTorch website.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Once PyTorch is installed, open your terminal and clone the project's GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kha-white/manhwa-ocr-tool.git
cd manhwa-ocr-tool
```
*(Note: Replace the URL with the official repository URL if it differs.)*

### Step 3: Install Other Dependencies

Now, install the remaining required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

Launch the tool from your terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 2. Via Executable (Alpha / Unstable)

> **Warning:** Pre-compiled executables are currently in an **alpha** stage. They are intended for testing only and may be broken or experience critical errors (like import errors on launch). For a stable experience, please use the "From Source Code" method above.

If you wish to test an executable:

1.  **Download:** Go to the official GitHub releases page and download the latest package for your operating system (Windows or macOS).
2.  **Install:**
    *   **Windows:** Run the `.exe` installer or extract the portable `.zip` file.
    *   **macOS:** Open the `.dmg` file and drag the icon into your Applications folder.

## Common Installation Issues

### GUI Library Conflict (PyQt5 vs. PySide6)

The application is built with `PySide6`. If you have the conflicting `PyQt5` library installed, it will not start. The tool is designed to detect this and will show a detailed error message with a "Copy Commands" button.

If you encounter this, follow the on-screen instructions or see our **[Troubleshooting Guide](/getting-started/errors/)** for a step-by-step solution.
