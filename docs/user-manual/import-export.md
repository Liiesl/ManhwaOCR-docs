# Import & Export

The Manhwa OCR Tool offers versatile import and export options, allowing you to integrate with other tools, share your work, or create final, translated images. Access these features via the `Import/Export Menu` (three bars icon) in the Right Panel's top controls.

## 1. Export OCR Results

This function exports your OCR text and associated metadata for archival purposes or use in other applications.

1.  Click the `Import/Export Menu` button.
2.  Select `Export OCR Results`.
3.  A dialog will prompt you to choose a format:
    *   **JSON (.json):** A comprehensive format containing all OCR data: text, coordinates, confidence scores, filenames, current profile translations, and custom styling. This is ideal for developers or for creating a complete backup.
    *   **`for-translate` Markdown (.md):** A custom Markdown format designed for easy translation. It strips visual metadata, uses a `<!-- file: -->` tag to identify the source image, and includes `-/row_number\-` delimiters to uniquely identify each text entry. This clean format is perfect for sharing with translators or using with external translation services.
4.  After selecting a format, choose a save location and provide a filename for your export.

## 2. Import Translation File

This feature allows you to import translated text from an external file back into your project. The imported text will be added as a new profile, making it easy to compare with your other versions. The file must be in the `for-translate` Markdown or JSON format generated by this tool.

1.  Click the `Import/Export Menu` button.
2.  Select `Import Translation File`.
3.  In the file dialog, navigate to and select your `.md` or `.json` translation file.
4.  The imported text will be added as a new profile (e.g., "Imported Translation") to your project, which you can then access from the [Profile Selector](/user-manual/project-management/#managing-profiles).

## 3. Export Rendered Images

This powerful feature creates new image files with the text boxes from your selected profile "burned" onto them. It's the perfect way to generate final, translated images for distribution.

1.  Click the `Import/Export Menu` button.
2.  Select `Export Rendered Images`.
3.  An export options dialog will open:
    *   **Output Directory:** Choose the folder where the new images will be saved.
    *   **Image Format:** Select the desired output format (e.g., `PNG`, `JPEG`).
    *   **Quality:** (For JPEG only) Adjust the image compression quality.
    *   **Profile:** This is the most important setting. Select which [text profile](/user-manual/project-management/#managing-profiles) (e.g., "Original", "User Edit 1", "Gemini Translation (English)") you want to render on the images. The text and styling will be taken from this profile.
4.  Click `Export`. The application will process each image and save the final rendered versions to your specified directory.
